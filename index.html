                <h3 class="tribute-headline">Biography</h3>
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an 
                    American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year 
                    career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded
                    as one of the greatest players of all time, Bryant helped the Lakers win five NBA championships, 
                    and was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive
                    Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the
                    NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring
                    and all-time postseason scoring lists.</p>
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was recognized as 
                    the top high-school basketball player in the U.S. while at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. 
                    The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft after graduation, and was 
                    selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers.
                    As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk 
                    Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal,
                    the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002</p>
